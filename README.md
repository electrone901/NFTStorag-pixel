The data is stored on IPFS and the generated hash will be used to view the transactions details.

# How it's made

NFT Pixels application makes use of the following softwares:

### `NFTStorage` for data storage on IPFS that generates a transation hash used to retrive the NFT .

### `Solidity` for the smart contract

### `OpenZeppelin ERC721` we use the ERC721 template for a faster development of the smart contract

### `Ganache` for local blockchain development

### `Polygon, Matic Network` the network I deployed the app

### `React Js, Material-ui, Web3` React Js for the frontend, Material-ui and Web3 to connect to blockchain.

### `Unlock Protocol` to allow users to pay for exclusive content this protocol was a big part of our use case.
